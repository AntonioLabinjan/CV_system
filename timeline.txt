Week 7:
Day 45-47: Integrate payment calculation functions with the database.
Day 48-50: Create and test scripts to update payment records in the database.
Day 51-52: Conduct initial testing and debugging of payment calculation and integration.

Phase 4: User Interface Development (Weeks 8-10)

Week 8:
Day 53-55: Design wireframes and mockups for the user interface.
Day 56-58: Set up the web framework (Flask/Django) and start building the frontend.

Week 9:
Day 59-61: Develop the employee management interface, including forms for inputting and updating employee information.
Day 62-64: Implement list view for employees with options to edit or delete records.
Day 65-66: Integrate frontend with the backend to display and manage employee data.

Week 10:
Day 67-69: Develop attendance reporting interface to display daily attendance records.

Phase 5: Testing and Deployment (Weeks 11-12)

Week 11:
Day 75-77: Perform comprehensive testing of the entire system, including facial recognition, payment calculation, and user interface.
Day 78-80: Identify and fix any bugs or issues discovered during testing.
Day 81-82: Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with a small group of employees.

Week 12:
Day 83-85: Finalize documentation, including user manuals and technical documentation.
Day 86-88: Prepare deployment environment and deploy the system.
Day 89-90: Provide training to users and administrators on how to use the system.

Post-Deployment (Ongoing)

Maintenance and Support:
Provide ongoing support for the system, addressing any issues that arise.
Regularly update the system to incorporate new features and improvements based on user feedback.
Ensure the system remains secure and up-to-date with the latest technologies.

Summary
This detailed timeline provides a structured approach to developing the smart employee attendance and payment system, ensuring that each phase is thoroughly planned and executed. Regular testing and feedback loops are included to ensure the system meets the desired requirements and operates smoothly.
